Open FinTech API

## ABOUT

The Open FinTech API is a set of open interfaces for nodes in FinTech ecosystem:

1. Application deveiopers may target and test interfaces with real data until banks and other endpoints prepare 
2. Endpoint providers may see which applications are welcome for their clients and direct funding towards implementing this API
3. Blockchain services may provide alternative platforms for existing interfaces

We use OpenAPI Specifications and custom autodiscovery protocol.

The project developed for nth FinTech Hackaton in Minsk (#FTH17), where for another consequitive year no API were provided for application developers from banks, except for some beta API from Visa (which still came without required info about ATMs).

The motto of this hackaton was "Building FinTech Ecosystem in Belarus".
